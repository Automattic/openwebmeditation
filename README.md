# Open Web Meditation

#### An Automattic Design Experiment

##### Overview
What is the world of the open web like, beyond the walls of dominant social media platforms? How do our experiences of the internet differ depending on where we spend our time and share our ideas? Come with us on a journey to explore the landscape of the web and get to know the people and possibilities of open source, the open web, and open opportunities.

_“The technology industry, like all industries, follows cycles, and the pendulum is swinging back to the broad, empowering philosophies that underpinned the early social web. But we’re going to face a big challenge with re-educating a billion people about what the web means.”_

—Anil Dash, [The Web We Lost](https://anildash.com/2012/12/13/the_web_we_lost/)
