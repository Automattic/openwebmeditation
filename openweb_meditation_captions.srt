1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,550
Take a deep breath.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,599
Pause and notice the sensations

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,280
of your body.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,840
Relax your arms.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,870
Feel your breath moving in

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,530
and out.

7
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,670
Now imagine you're standing in a
field.

8
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,620
The grass is green.

9
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,730
There's a light breeze.

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,820
The air is warm.

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,380
With each breath in.

12
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,706
Imagine you are getting lighter

13
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,250
and lighter and lighter.

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,580
With a little help from the breeze,

15
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,540
you begin to float upwards.

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,870
As you rise higher

17
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,849
and fly around you see something

18
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:37,350
down below through the clouds.

19
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,899
As you get closer the air gets

20
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:40,299
smoggier

21
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,750
and you realize it's a vast
metropolis.

22
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,390
It's surrounded by high concrete
walls,

23
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,500
completely contained.

24
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,769
Inside it's bustling â€” lots

25
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,558
of honking traffic, people
everywhere,

26
00:00:52,758 --> 00:00:54,460
the sound is deafening.

27
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,539
You see people arguing in bars

28
00:00:57,739 --> 00:00:59,070
and chatting on street corners.

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,680
Billboards and advertisements are
everywhere,

30
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,869
touting every kind of good

31
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:03,690
and service.

32
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,309
It's noisy

33
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:06,770
and dense and overwhelming.

34
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,730
This is Facebook.

35
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:12,940
You float back up,

36
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,789
flying out of the city smog

37
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:15,870
and into clear air.

38
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,859
As you fly you encounter a sprawling

39
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:19,520
suburbia.

40
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,572
It has walls and hedges too, but

41
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,870
they're shiny and newer.

42
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,429
The residents are still bustling

43
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:28,050
and chatting but there's less noise.

44
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,100
The streets and houses are picture
perfect.

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,740
The people pay a lot of attention to
how they dress.

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,929
But all the houses are boxy

47
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:36,710
and identical.

48
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,409
And they're all on identical streets
in a perfect

49
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:39,760
grid.

50
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,790
When you look closer at some of the
houses

51
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,699
you realize they're actually just
billboards

52
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:46,070
made to look like someone lives
there.

53
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,800
This is Instagram.

54
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,059
You fly back up and want to

55
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,620
see what else is out there in the
world.

56
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,110
As the suburbs fade into the
distance

57
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,179
the rest of the world comes into
focus

58
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:01,010
on the horizon.

59
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,119
You see farmsteads in remote corners
of

60
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:04,960
the countryside.

61
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,270
You see riverside factories.

62
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,819
You see backpackers on
mountainsides.

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,800
You see small settlements

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,150
and emerging new cities.

65
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,859
You see apartment buildings

66
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:15,464
and straw huts, sprawling

67
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,800
homesteads and local churches.

68
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,309
This diverse group of people value
their

69
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,139
freedom but they dream of some of
the

70
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:26,279
comforts of city

71
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,120
and suburban life.

72
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,342
Utilities and services,

73
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,660
same day mail delivery,

74
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,800
cable TV,

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,870
corner stores with all the
amenities.

76
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,479
They want ways to make their houses
bigger

77
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:37,230
and stronger,

78
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,629
tools to make their business more
valuable for

79
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,540
customers, and roads

80
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,120
to connect them to other people.

81
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,990
Eventually you fly past the last
settlement

82
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,510
and find yourself back in an open
field.

83
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,427
And as your breathing slows,

84
00:02:56,627 --> 00:02:58,160
you get heavier

85
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,383
and heavier,

86
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,830
until eventually

87
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,313
you settle back down to earth.
