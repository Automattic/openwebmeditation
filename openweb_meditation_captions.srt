1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,414
Take a deep breath. Pause

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,919
and notice the sensations of your
body.

3
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:05,319
Relax

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:07,780
Your arms,

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,800
feel your breath moving in

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,460
and out.

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,630
Now imagine you're standing in a
field.

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,220
The grass is green, there's

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,226
a light breeze, the

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,620
air is warm. With

11
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,305
each breath in,

12
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:26,240
imagine you are getting lighter

13
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,170
and lighter.

14
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,515
With a little help from the breeze,

15
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:30,907
you begin to float upwards.

16
00:00:31,107 --> 00:00:31,307
As

17
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,850
you rise higher

18
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,900
and fly around,

19
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,300
you see something down below through
the clouds.

20
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,849
As you get closer, the air gets

21
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:40,186
smoggier

22
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,700
and you realize it's a vast
metropolis.

23
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,330
Surrounded by high concrete walls,

24
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,440
completely contained.

25
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,960
Inside, it's bustling.

26
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,640
Lots of honking traffic,

27
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,400
people everywhere, the sound is
deafening.

28
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,519
You see people arguing in bars

29
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,020
and chatting on street corners.

30
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,630
Billboards and advertisements are
everywhere

31
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,600
touting every kind of good in
service.

32
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,829
It's noisy and dense

33
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:06,670
and overwhelming.

34
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,640
This is Facebook.

35
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,880
You float back up,

36
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,779
flying out of the city smog

37
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:15,620
and into clear air. As

38
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,460
You fly, you encounter a sprawling
suburbia.

39
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,190
It has walls and hedges too,

40
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,269
but they're shinier

41
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:23,810
and newer.

42
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,389
The residents are still bustling

43
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:27,950
and chatting but there's less noise.

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,070
The streets and houses are picture
perfect.

45
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,362
The people pay a lot of attention to
how they dress.

46
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:35,359
But all the houses

47
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:36,650
are boxy and identical,

48
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,349
and they're all in identical streets
in a perfect

49
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:39,710
grid.

50
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,740
When you look closer at some of the
houses,

51
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,659
you realize they're actually just
billboards

52
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:46,070
made to look like someone lives
there.

53
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,740
This is Instagram.

54
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,130
You fly back up

55
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,590
and want to see what else is out
there in the world.

56
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,584
As the suburbs fade into the
distance,

57
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,509
the rest of the world comes

58
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:00,950
into focus on the horizon.

59
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,159
You see farmsteads in remote corners
of the

60
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:04,880
countryside.

61
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,449
You see riverside factories,

62
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:08,749
you see backpackers

63
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,162
on mountainsides, you

64
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,780
see small settlements

65
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,100
and emerging new cities.

66
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,839
You see apartment buildings

67
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:15,740
and straw huts.

68
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,600
Sprawling homesteads

69
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,740
and local churches.

70
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,629
This diverse group of people value
their

71
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:23,110
freedom

72
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,240
but they dream of some of the
comforts

73
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,530
of city and suburban life.

74
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,170
Utilities and services.

75
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,760
Same day mail delivery.

76
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,870
Cable TV.

77
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,829
Corner stores

78
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:33,970
with all the amenities.

79
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,459
They want ways to make their houses
bigger

80
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:37,150
and stronger,

81
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,429
tools to make their business more
valuable

82
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:40,360
for customers,

83
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,060
and roads to connect them to other
people.

84
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,900
Eventually you fly past the last
settlement

85
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,420
and find yourself back in an open
field.

86
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,397
And as your breathing slows,

87
00:02:56,597 --> 00:02:58,120
you get heavier

88
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,790
and heavier,

89
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,669
until eventually you settle back

90
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:03,450
down to earth.
